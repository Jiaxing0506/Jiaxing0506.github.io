## Task 2: Survival Analysis Report

### Brief Introduction
In Task 2, I conducted a survival analysis on a telecommunications dataset to study customer churn. Survival analysis is a statistical method used to analyze the time until an event of interest occursâ€”here, the event is customer churn (when a customer leaves the service, i.e., `Churn = 'Yes'`). Using PySpark, I followed the official Spark casebook to preprocess the data, estimate the survival function with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and analyze the impact of features like contract type and monthly charges on churn risk.
